# SpaceX Payload Mass vs. Launch Success Dashboard

This dashboard explores the relationship between **payload mass** and the success or failure of SpaceX launches. It visualizes how different payload masses impact the likelihood of a successful launch, broken down into 2kg increments for detailed analysis.

### Key Features of the Dashboard:
- **Success vs. Failure Counts**: Visualized using a histogram with color-coded bars representing successful and failed launches across various payload mass ranges.
- **Interactive Filters**: Filter the data by **date range**, **orbit type**, and **launch outcome** to explore specific subsets of the data.
- **Payload Mass Bins**: Payload mass is displayed in 2kg increments, providing granular insight into how payload size impacts launch success.

### Data Source:
The data used in this dashboard was web-scraped from SpaceX launch data, and the key correlation analyzed was between **payload mass** and **launch success**. Although the correlation value was **0.06237**, indicating a weak relationship, payload mass remains an interesting factor to explore in conjunction with other attributes like orbit type and launch date.
